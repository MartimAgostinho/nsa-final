\section{Simulation}

In this section is presented the simulation of the design obtained from the previous section in Cadence.

The first step was to simulate the circuit with the transistors specifications obtained from the optimization process. Subsequently, was performed a fine-tuning of the circuit to improve the results by performing the value sweep of the most critical transistors.

The schematic of the circuit obtained in Cadence is shown in Figure \ref{fig:OP}.
