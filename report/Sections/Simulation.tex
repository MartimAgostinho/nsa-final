\section{Simulation}

In this section is presented the simulation of the design obtained from the previous section.

The first step was to simulate the circuit with the transistors specifications obtained from the optimization process. Subsequently, was performed a fine tuning of the circuit to improve the results by performing the value sweep of the most critical transisotrs.
