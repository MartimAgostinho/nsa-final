\section{Optimization and Dimensioning?}

The optimization and dimensioning of the circuit was done using a Python script. To acomplish the goals and constainsts of the labwork statement, and considering the theoretical analysis, the script was used to find the best fit values for the transistors sizes and the biasing circuit. The script was also used to calculate the merit of the circuit.
